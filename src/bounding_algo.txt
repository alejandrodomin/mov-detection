# based on Suzuki Contour Algo and the Fast Countour Algo paper that was linked

loop over matrix until you find a pixel value greater than zero
mark as your starting point

check all valid directions around this pixel of value greater than zero
add those into a queue
loop over this until the queue is empty
while you loop check the min and max for coordinates this will give us our upper left and lower right combos

add the new pair of coordinates into a dont check again list
continue looping over the matrix and whenever a pixel is within the don't check again box skip it over

repeat from step 1 until all pixel clusters are found.
